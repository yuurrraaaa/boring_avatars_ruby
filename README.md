## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'boring_avatars_ruby'
```

And then execute:

```ruby
bundle install
```

Or install it yourself as:

```ruby
gem install boring_avatars_ruby
```

## Usage

Creating an avatar with default properties and returning a string containing the SVG output

```ruby
avatar = BoringAvatarsRuby::Avatar.create({name: "Grace Hopper"})
```

Overriding default property values

```ruby
avatar = BoringAvatarsRuby::Avatar.create({
  colors: ["#264653", "#2a9d8f", "#e9c46a", "#f4a261", "#e76f51"],
  name: "Grace Hopper",
  size: 120,
  variant: :marble
})
```

### Variants

There are a number of variants that have been carried over from Boring Avatars: -

* Marble
* Pixel
* Ring
* Sunset

Additionally, an `identicon` variant has been ported from [Ruby Identicon](https://github.com/chrisbranson/ruby_identicon)

### Properties

| Property | Type                                                                               |
| -------- |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| size     | number (verical and horizontal size in pixels)                                     |
| square   | boolean (a square avatar is created if `true`)                                     |
| name     | string                                                                             |
| variant  | one of: `:marble`, `:pixel`, `:ring`, `:sunset`, `:identicon`, `:beam`, `:bauhaus` |
| colors   | array of colors in rgb notation                                                    |

The `identicon` variant ignores the `color`, `size` and `square` properties and has the following additional properties: -

| Property           | Type                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| background_color  | string, default: `:transparent` (the background color of the identicon in rgb notation (e.g. 0xffffff for white))    |
| border_size       | number, default 35 (the size in pixels to leave as an empty border around the identicon image)                       |
| grid_size         | number, default 7 (the number of rows and columns in the identicon, minimum 4, maximum 9)                            |
| square_size       | number, default 50 (the size in pixels of each square that makes up the identicon)                                   |
| key               | string, a 16 byte key used by siphash when calculating the hash value (see note below)                               |

*Varying the key ensures uniqueness of an identicon for a given title, it is assumed desirable for different applications to use a different key.*

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
